                    data-description="A power snatch involves taking the bar from the ground position to an overhead position as efficiently as possible, with as much weight as possible. This movement is a staple in the Crossfit and Olympic weightlifting worlds. Crossfit Games athlete Emily Bridgers demonstrates how to do a power snatch and shares some tips for improving yours.">

                    data-description="In the snatch, the bar should remain as close to the legs as possible during the pull and then come into full contact with the hips as the trunk reaches approximately vertical. If you’re having trouble getting the bar to contact, or contacting effectively, this is for you. The primary influences for contact are the most basic elements of any lift—balance and posture. Balance over the whole foot and a posture that keeps the shoulder joint close to above the bar rather than significantly in front of it will help proper bar contact happen more naturally. The bar wants to hang below the shoulder joint, so if the shoulder is positioned correctly, the bar will already be close to the body and easy to bring closer. If instead the shoulders are too far forward, it takes an extraordinary effort to bring the bar back to the body. The continuous, active effort by the upper body to keep the bar close handles what posture and balance can’t. To feel and practice the upper body action of bringing the bar closer, stand tall with a bar hanging in a snatch grip. Keeping the arms relaxed, push your hands back to press bar against your hips.  Next, move into a mid-thigh hang position with the shoulders slightly in front of the bar. Relax to let the bar hang directly below the shoulders, which will mean it moves away from the legs. Now simply replicate the previous—push the hands back toward the body while keeping the arms relaxed until the bar lightly contacts the thighs.  This upper body effort should be continuous from start to finish of the pull. With proper posture and balance, it will take very little effort in the first pull, and then more once past the knees when the shoulders will tend to be farther in front of the bar. Finally, remember that a snatch should finish at the top with the legs vertical and the shoulders at least slightly behind the hips—in this position, the bar is forced to contact the body because it’s following the shoulders. In other words, except with extremely light weights and other errors, you can’t avoid contact if you’re finishing the pull correctly. Continue pushing vertically with the legs as you finish the hip extension—this ensures the bar continues moving up through this contact rather than hitting a single point and bouncing forward. Focus on this active guidance of the bar and correct contact with all pulling variations you’re already doing. You can emphasize it more by slowing the pull down to allow better adjustment and control. This can also be done with actual snatches—pull from the floor to mid-thigh slowly to ensure perfect positions, then accelerate to finish the snatch normally, focusing on creating the final proper contact at the hips.">

                    data-description="A good way to improve the aggression, timing and duration of your leg drive in the snatch is using the snatch with no jump—or as some of you goofballs call it, a no foot snatch—but only if you do it right. If you don’t, it actually reinforces the very problems it’s supposed to be fixing. It’s really easy to snatch without moving your feet—all you have to do is have limp legs at top of the pull or completely take over with the hips—but obviously neither of those is going to solve the problem of poor leg drive. The feet need to stay planted not because of lack of leg power or cutting the drive off early, but because of an exaggeration of both—we’re intentionally driving harder and longer. This means we’re still pushing through the floor as we begin pulling with the arms, which keeps the pressure against the floor at the moment it would otherwise be released—pulling against the bar pushes us down against the floor. The easiest way to think of the correct timing is to imagine doing a snatch high-pull in which you suddenly remember near the end that you need to snatch it. In other words, aim to not move under the bar until you’ve gotten through about half the distance of the arm motion of a high-pull. To be clear, this delayed timing does NOT mean the pull under is slow or unaggressive—it actually needs to be more aggressive. It’s also important to understand this doesn’t mean that we want this same timing in a regular snatch—it’s an exaggeration to achieve a specific training objective. Bottom line: Don’t think of the exercise as simply not moving your feet—think of it as continuing to push your feet through the floor so hard that they’re unable to move.">

                    data-description="The clean & jerk is the second of the two lifts—the snatch and the clean & jerk—contested in the sport of weightlifting (AKA Olympic weightlifting). The athlete lifts the barbell first from the floor to the shoulders, and then from the shoulders to overhead. Jerk implies the lifter’s chosen competitive jerk style, which is most commonly the split jerk. With a clean-width grip (hands half a fist to a fist-width outside the shoulders), set the starting position tightly—feet approximately hip width and toes turned out with the weight balanced evenly across them; bar over the balls of the foot; knees pushed out to the sides inside the arms; trunk braced forcefully with the back extended; shoulder joint above the bar; arms relaxed and straight; head and eyes forward. Push with the legs against the floor through the whole foot similarly to a squat, maintaining approximately the same back angle until the bar is above the knee. Continue aggressively pushing against the floor with the legs and extend the hips violently, keeping the bar as close to the body as possible and ensuring full contact with the upper thigh. Once you have extended the body completely, pull the elbows up and out to begin moving your body down, and lift and move your feet into your receiving stance as you squat under the bar. Spin the elbows around the bar to establish a secure rack position—bar in between the throat and highest point of the shoulders; shoulders protracted and slightly elevated; grip relaxed; elbows lifted high. Drive back up from the bottom of the squat immediately and aggressively, position the feet in the jerk drive stance, and adjust into the jerk rack position—keeping the bar and shoulders in the same position, get the hands deeper under the bar and bring the elbows down but still in front of the bar. Get one or more new breaths, then pressurize and brace the trunk for the jerk. Dip by bending at the knees only with the trunk vertical and maintaining your balance to a depth of approximately 10% of your height. Brake as quickly as possible in the bottom and drive straight back up aggressively with the legs to accelerate the barbell upward maximally. As you finish the extension of the legs, push the bar up and slightly back with the arms to preserve as much bar speed as possible, and quickly move the feet into the split position as you punch the elbows into a secure overhead position. Secure and stabilize the bar before recovering from the split into a standing position with the bar still overhead. ">

                    data-description="The power jerk is the second most common style after the split jerk in competition, and a frequently used training exercise even for lifters who split jerk. Stand with the heels approximately hip-width and the toes turned out, with the weight balanced slightly more toward the heels but the full foot in contact with the floor. Hold the bar in the jerk rack position—bar in between the throat and highest point of the shoulders; shoulders protracted and slightly elevated; hands as deep under the bar as possible; grip relaxed; elbows down but in front of the bar and out to the sides.

As you finish the extension of the legs, push the bar up and slightly back with the arms to preserve as much bar speed as possible, and quickly move the feet into your squat stance as you punch the elbows into a secure overhead position and sit into a partial squat—any depth above a parallel squat is considered a power jerk; below that is a squat jerk. Secure and stabilize the bar before recovering to a standing position with the bar still overhead.">
